    "# 01 - Data and Data import\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first section we will detail everything about the dataset and the pre-preparation we had to do to it in order to allow us to use it for our project. The [data](https://www.simpleweb.org/wiki/index.php/SSH_datasets) that we used was a selection of SSH logs from the linked web page. Originally we wanted to attempt to access the data directly from the [source link](http://traces.simpleweb.org/ssh_datasets/dataset2_log_files.tgz), however this proved problematic due to the nature of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We downloaded and inspected the data to find that it was off the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `dataset2_log_files.tgz`\n",
    "    * `dataset2_log_files.tar`\n",
    "        * `ip-address1`\n",
    "            * `auth.log.anon`\n",
    "        * `ip-address2`\n",
    "            * `auth.log.anon`\n",
    "        *      ...\n",
    "        * `ip-address73`\n",
    "            * `auth.log.anon`\n",
    "            \n",
    "Essentially what we had were 73 seperate `.log` files for different ips on the network that the data was recorded on (Campus network of the University of Twente, Netherlands). In order to work with this in the way that we wanted we had to do rather a lot of manual file management to allow us to use this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this, we read the details on the page that we downloaded the data from, which had this to say:\n",
    ">     1. Merging: On some machines, the authentication logs were distributed over hostname.messages and hostname.warn. We have merged those log files, sorted them again (if necessary), and removed any introduced duplicates.\n",
    "    2. Renaming: The file names have been changed from hostname.extension into anonymized_IP_address.extension. As such, the log files can easily be correlated with the flow data.\n",
    "    3. Anonymization: We have replaced any usernames by \"XXXXX\" and hostnames by the anonymized IP address of the considered host.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Due to the anonymising of the data the ip address we see are not the originals, but every instance of them corresponds to the same value. Another key point that we will touch on in the next section of the report is how the usernames have been anonymised to \"XXXXX\". This anonymising process has caused the log files to be represented as `auth.log.anon` and so for ease of reading and accessibility while keeping potentially important data intact we had to do the following steps:\n",
    "* Copy each `auth.log.anon` file in turn to the GitHub repository on my hardrive in order to push to the master.\n",
    "    * As part of this process as we copied each in turn from their respective ip-address folder we renamed the file to \"1.log\" for the first file, \"2.log\" for the second file etc.\n",
    "    * We've changed the file extension and this allows us to read the log files in our text editor or a program such as excel as normal.\n",
    "* \"26.log\" was especially large and this highlighted that it would be beneficial to compress with gzip our log files, so we did this for all 73 files.\n",
    "* In order to keep track of the ip addresses so that we know where each log has come from, we made a text file, seperated by commas, detailing each ip address in turn (so the 1st ip address corresponds to it's appropriate .log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code that follows you'll see how we then handled this data in order to create a good dataset to work on."
